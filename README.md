# Tiling-based Metastructures Repository

Welcome to the **Tiling-basedMetastructures** repository: This repository contains datasets of structural designs along with their corresponding effective properties.

For each design, you will find the effective Poisson's ratio and fundamental natural frequency. The metastructure designs are generated using a periodic tiling-based technique.
